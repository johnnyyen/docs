* This API call is <em>idempotent</em>, which means it is safe to submit a request with the same `payoutId` multiple times. 
* Duplicate requests with the same `payoutId` will be ignored with the `DUPLICATE_IGNORED` status.
* Since the request can be rejected, you must check the `status` code in the response for each submitted request. The `rejectionReason` in the response will contain information about the reason of the rejection.

Each request can become either ACCEPTED, ENQUEUED, REJECTED or DUPLICATE_IGNORED:

Status | <Tooltip tip="Will a callback be delivered after receiving this status on initiation?">Callback</Tooltip> | Description
-------|----------|------------
`ACCEPTED` | Yes | The payout request has been **accepted** by pawaPay for processing.
`ENQUEUED` | Yes | The payout request has been **accepted**, but has been enqueued for processing later. Read more about [enqueued payouts](/payouts#enqueued-payouts).
`REJECTED` | No | The payout request has been **rejected**. See `rejectionReason` for details. 
`DUPLICATE_IGNORED` | No | The payout request has been **ignored** as a duplicate of an already accepted payout request. Duplication logic relies upon `payoutId`.

### How do i find out the final status of this payout?

As the pawaPay Merchant API is an [asynchronous API](/implementation#asynchronous-api), you can find out the final status of the `ACCEPTED` or `ENQUEUED` payout by either:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Waiting for a callback" icon="webhook" href="/v1/api-reference/payouts/payout-callback" horizontal="true">
        If you have configured callbacks, just wait for it.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Checking the status" icon="code-compare" href="/v1/api-reference/payouts/check-payout-status" horizontal="true">
        Or poll the Check Payout Status endpoint.
