Bulk payouts operation allows you to initiate multiple payouts for asynchronous processing. Read more about [Payouts](/payouts).

* Bulk requests with more than 20 payout transactions may be rejected by pawaPay. 
* This API call is <em>idempotent</em>, which means it is safe to submit a request with the same `payoutId` multiple times. 
* Duplicate requests with the same `payoutId` will be ignored with the `DUPLICATE_IGNORED` status.
* Since the request can be rejected, you must check the `status` code in the response for each submitted request. The `rejectionReason` in the response will contain information about the reason of the rejection.
* Callback will be delivered separately for each payout in the bulk request as the payouts are resolved to their final status.

Each individual request can get one of the statuses on initiation:

Status | <Tooltip tip="Will a callback be delivered after receiving this status on initiation?">Callback</Tooltip> | Description
-------|----------|------------
`ACCEPTED` | Yes | The payout request has been **accepted** by pawaPay for processing.
`ENQUEUED` | Yes | The payout request has been **accepted**, but has been enqueued for processing later. Read more about [enqueued payouts](/payouts#enqueued-payouts).
`REJECTED` | No | The payout request has been **rejected**. See `rejectionReason` for details. 
`DUPLICATE_IGNORED` | No | The payout request has been **ignored** as a duplicate of an already accepted payout request. Duplication logic relies upon `payoutId`.

### How do i find out the final statuses of these payouts?

As the pawaPay Merchant API is an [asynchronous API](/implementation#asynchronous-api), you can find out the final status of the **accepted** payout by either:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Waiting for a callback" icon="webhook" href="/v1/api-reference/payouts/payout-callback" horizontal="true">
        If you have configured callbacks, just wait for it.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Checking the status" icon="code-compare" href="/v1/api-reference/payouts/check-payout-status" horizontal="true">
        Or poll the Check Payout Status endpoint.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>
