Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) sometimes have instability in processing payments. Read more about [MNO Stability](/implementation#mno-stability).

Our 24/7 payment operations team constantly monitors all the MNOs available on our platform for any degraded performance or downtime.
From this endpoint you can get the current processing status of each MNO.
This endpoint returns all MNOs (correspondents) grouped by country. 
Each operation type has a separate status. 

Following statuses are possible for different operations:

Status | Description
-------------------------------|------------
`OPERATIONAL` | The MNO (correspondent) is operational and open for processing requests.
`DELAYED` | The MNO (correspondent) is having problems processing **payouts**. Our payment operations team is currently monitoring the MNO. **Payouts are being enqueued** and will be processed once the problems have been resolved. 
`CLOSED` | The MNO (correspondent) is having problems and all requests are being **rejected** by pawaPay.
