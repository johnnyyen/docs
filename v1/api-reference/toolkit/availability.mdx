Mobile Money Operators (MMOs) sometimes have instability in processing payments. Read more about [MMO Stability](/implementation#mmo-stability).

Our 24/7 payment operations team constantly monitors all the MMOs available on our platform for any degraded performance or downtime.
From this endpoint you can get the current processing status of each MMO.
This endpoint returns all MMOs (correspondents) grouped by country. 
Each operation type has a separate status. 

Following statuses are possible for different operations:

Status | Description
-------------------------------|------------
`OPERATIONAL` | The MMO (correspondent) is operational and open for processing requests.
`DELAYED` | The MMO (correspondent) is having problems processing **payouts**. Our payment operations team is currently monitoring the MMO. **Payouts are being enqueued** and will be processed once the problems have been resolved. 
`CLOSED` | The MMO (correspondent) is having problems and all requests are being **rejected** by pawaPay.
