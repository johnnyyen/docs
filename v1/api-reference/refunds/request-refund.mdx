* This API call is <em>idempotent</em>, which means it is safe to submit a request with the same `refundId` multiple times. 
* Duplicate requests with the same `refundId` will be ignored with the `DUPLICATE_IGNORED` status in the response.
* Since the request can be rejected, you must check the `status` code in the response for each submitted request. The `rejectionReason` in the response will contain information about the reason of the rejection.

Each request can get one of the statuses on initiation:

Status | <Tooltip tip="Will a callback be delivered after receiving this status on initiation?">Callback</Tooltip> | Description
-------|----------|------------
`ACCEPTED` | Yes | The refund request has been **accepted** by pawaPay for processing.
`REJECTED` | No | The refund request has been **rejected**. See `rejectionReason` for details.
`DUPLICATE_IGNORED` | No | The refund request has been ignored as a duplicate of an already accepted refund request. Duplication logic relies upon `refundId`.

### How to find out the final status of this refund?

As the pawaPay Merchant API is an [asynchronous API](/implementation#asynchronous-api), you can find out the final status of the `ACCEPTED` refund by either:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Waiting for a callback" icon="webhook" href="/v1/api-reference/refunds/refund-callback" horizontal="true">
        If you have configured callbacks, just wait for it.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Checking the status" icon="code-compare" href="/v1/api-reference/refunds/check-refund-status" horizontal="true">
        Or poll the Check Refund Status endpoint.
    </Card>
