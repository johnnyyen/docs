Initiates a payment session using the pawaPay Payment Page. 
<Card title="Learn more!" icon="readme" href="/payment_page" horizontal="true">
    See how the Payment Page works for your customers.
</Card>

* The request will return a `redirectURL`. 
* The customer should be forwarded to this URL to start the payment process.
* Once the customer completes the payment process on the Payment Page, they will be fowarded to the `returnUrl`. 
* The original `depositId` will be passed as a query parameter.

Your page on the `returnUrl` has two options to determine the status of the payment. You can do that by either: 

<CardGroup cols={2}>

        If you have configured callbacks, just wait for it.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Checking the status" icon="code-compare" href="../deposits/check-deposit-status" horizontal="true">
        Or poll the Check Deposit Status endpoint.
    </Card>
