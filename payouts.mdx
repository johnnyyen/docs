You can disburse money from your pawaPay account to a customers mobile money wallet.

This operation does not involve the recipient having to authorise the transaction by entering their PIN code. The operation is usually processed within seconds.

After we receive a payout request, we send it to the MNO specified as the [correspondent](/using_the_api#correspondents). 
When the MNO finalizes your payout request, it will inform pawaPay and consequently pawaPay notifies you of the result by calling your defined [callback URL](/using_the_api#callback-urls) with a **[Payout Status Callback](/v1/api-reference/payouts/payout-callback)** (if configured). 
If you have not configured callbacks, you can always check the status of your payout request through our **[Get Payout Status and Details](/v1/api-reference/payouts/check-payout-status)** endpoint. 

<Tip>Please follow the guidelines in the [Implementation](/implementation) section of our API docs to ensure a reliable implementation.</Tip>

After your payout request has been **accepted** for processing, it can have one of the following statuses in the pawaPay platform:

Status | Description
-------|------------
`ACCEPTED` | The payout request has been **accepted** by pawaPay for processing.
`ENQUEUED` | The payout request has been **accepted**, but has been enqueued for processing later.
`SUBMITTED` | The payout request has been submitted to the MNO and is being processed.
`COMPLETED` | The payout request has been successful. This is a **final state**.
`FAILED` | The payout request has failed. This is a **final state**. 

## Enqueued payouts

Sometimes MNOs have either degraded performance or their systems are unavailable completely.
Read more about [MNO stability](/implementation#mno-stability).

Our Payment Operations team monitors the MNOs availability 24/7 and publishes that information on our [status page](https://status.pawapay.cloud/). 
This information is also accessible programmatically from our [availability](/v1/api-reference/toolkit/availability) endpoint.
When an MNO is not able to process payouts, our platform will still accepts payout requests for processing. 
Your payout request will return 'ENQUEUED' as the status.
The payout will be enqueued until the MNOs systems become operational.

You can always cancel the enqueued payout before it's processed using the [Cancel enqueued payout](/v1/api-reference/payouts/cancel-enqueued-payout) endpoint. 
It's also possible to cancel it from the pawaPay Dashboard as described in the [pawaPay Dashboard documentation](/dashboard/transactions/cancel_enqueued).
