## Implementation

Using the payment flow in your deposit or checkout experience is simple:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Start the session">
        When it's time for the customer to pay, [start a new session](#operation/create-session). **The session will time out after 15 minutes.**
    </Step>
    <Step title="Forward the customer">
        Forward the customer to the `redirectUrl` that you received in the response. 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Wait for them to return">
        The customer will complete the payment on the Payment Page and will be forwarded to `returnUrl`.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify the payment status">
        Your page on `returnUrl` should [verify the status](#operation/getDeposit) of the payment. The `depositId` will be passed as a URL parameter.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Handle accordingly">
        Based on the `status` of the payment handle a successful, failed or long running payment.
