title: Refunds
---

You can refund an already completed deposit from your pawaPay account back to the customer's mobile money wallet. 

This operation does not require the recipient to authorise the transaction. The operation is usually processed within seconds.

After receiving a refund request, we send it to the MMO specified as the [correspondent](/using_the_api#correspondents). 
When the MMO finalizes your refund request, it will inform pawaPay, and consequently, pawaPay will notify you of the result by calling your defined [callback URL](/using_the_api#callback-urls) with a **[Refund Status Callback](/v1/api-reference/refunds/refund-callback)** (if configured). 

If you have not configured callbacks, you can always check the status of your refund request through our **[Check Refund Status](/v1/api-reference/refunds/check-refund-status)** endpoint. 

<Tip>Please follow the guidelines in the [Implementation](/implementation) section of our API docs to ensure a reliable implementation.</Tip>

After your refund request has been **accepted** for processing, it can have one of the following statuses in the pawaPay platform:

Status | Description
-------|------------
`ACCEPTED` | The refund request has been **accepted** by pawaPay for processing.
`SUBMITTED` | The refund request has been submitted to the MMO and is being processed.
`COMPLETED` | The refund request has been successful. This is a **final state**.
`FAILED` | The refund request has failed. This is a **final state**.
