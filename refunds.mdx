You can refund an already completed collection (deposit) from your pawaPay account back to the customers mobile money wallet. 

This operation does not involve the recipient having to authorise the transaction. The operation is usually processed within seconds.

After we have received a refund request, we send it to the MNO specified as the [correspondent](/using_the_api#correspondents). 
When the MNO finalizes your refund request, it will inform pawaPay and consequently pawaPay notifies you of the result by calling your defined [callback URL](/using_the_api#callback-urls) with a **[Refund Status Callback](/v1/api-reference/refunds/refund-callback)** (if configured). 
If you have not configured callbacks, you can always check the status of your refund request through our **[Get Refund Status and Details](/v1/api-reference/refunds/check-refund-status)** endpoint. 

<Info>Please follow the guidelines in the [Implementation](/implementation) section of our API docs to ensure a reliable implementation.</Info>

After your refund request has been **accepted** for processing, it can have one of the following statuses in the pawaPay platform:

Status | Description
-------|------------
`ACCEPTED` | The refund request has been **accepted** by pawaPay for processing.
`SUBMITTED` | The refund request has been submitted to the MNO and is being processed.
`COMPLETED` | The refund request has been successful. This is a **final state**.
`FAILED` | The refund request has failed. This is a **final state**.
