You can request payment from a customer. Funds will be moved from the customers mobile money wallet to your account in pawaPay.

This operation needs to be explicitly authorised by the customer by entering their PIN code. 
The operation can take between a few seconds up to a few minutes to be processed successfully.

After the deposit request is sent to pawaPay, we forward the request to the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) specified as the [correspondent](/using_the_api#correspondents).
The MNO sends the request to the customer for authorization. 
The customer then authorizes the payment by entering their PIN code on their mobile phone. 
Upon customers authorization (or rejection), the MNO informs pawaPay of the result and consequently pawaPay notifies you of the result by calling your defined [callback URL](/using_the_api#callback-urls) with a **[Deposit Status Callback](/v1/api-reference/deposits/deposit-callback)** (if configured). 
If you have not configured callbacks, you can always check the status of your deposit request through our **[Deposit Get Status and Details](/v1/api-reference/deposits/check-deposit-status)** endpoint.

<Info>Please follow the guidelines in the [Implementation](/implementation) section of our API docs to ensure a reliable implementation.</Info>

After your deposit request has been **accepted** for processing, it can have one of the following statuses in the pawaPay platform:

Status | Description
-------|------------
`ACCEPTED` | The deposit request has been **accepted** by pawaPay for processing.
`SUBMITTED` | The deposit request has been submitted to the MNO and is being processed.
`COMPLETED` | The deposit request has been successful. This is a **final state**.
`FAILED` | The deposit request has failed. This is a **final state**.
