---
Any payment on our platform can be found quickly and easily using our global search which is always at the top left corner of the dashboard.

This functionality is available to users with the Transactions role. Read more about User roles.

## How to search
Enter one of the following into the search bar:

* Phone number (MSISDN)
* MNO Transaction ID
* Transaction ID (deposit ID, payout ID, refund ID)
* Full Metadata value

<Info>
    **Please note!**

    When searching using metadata, you must enter the full value. For example, if you are searching with the metadata field "invoiceID" set to "INV-12345", then searching for "12345" alone will not yield results.
