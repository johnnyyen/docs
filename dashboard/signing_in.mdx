title: Signing into the pawaPay dashboard
---

The pawaPay dashboard supports two methods of user authentication: traditional password-based authentication and Google-based authentication.

Should you opt for Google-based authentication, your organization must already utilize Google Workspace, or a comparable service where Google manages email addresses. This feature facilitates a seamless login process, allowing users to access our portal using their existing Google accounts.

<Info>
    We recommend forcing 2-step verification on your Google Workspace account for increased security.

## Password based authentication

When using password based authentication, you need to choose a password when activating your account. This password is then used to sign into the dashboard. 

<Info>
    Our dashboard follows OWASP AVSV Level 3 password policy.
