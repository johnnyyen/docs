title: How to sign in

The pawaPay dashboard supports two methods of user authentication: traditional password-based authentication and Google-based authentication.

Should you opt for Google-based authentication, your organization must already utilize [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/), or a comparable service where Google manages email addresses. This feature facilitates a seamless login process, allowing users to access our portal using their existing Google accounts.

<Tip>
    We recommend forcing 2-step verification on your Google Workspace account for increased security.

## Activating your account

When invited to our dashboard, you will receive an invitation email with an activation link.

Pressing on "Activate" will take you to the account activation page where you are asked to read and accept our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, and choose your authentication method - Google or username and password.

<Tip>
  The password meter at the bottom of the "Password" input helps you to choose a strong password to secure your account.
