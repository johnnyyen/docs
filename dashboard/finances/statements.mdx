You always have access to a full financial statement for each of your wallets to be able to audit and reconcile your balance on our platform.

## Search statements

To see every single transaction on your wallet, please start by choosing:
- The time period
- A wallet

![Wallet Search](/images/dashboard/finances/wallet_search.png)

Pressing "Show" will display a table with the transactions on this wallet for the selected period. You can also limit the results to specific Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) or transaction types.

> **Please note!**  
> - You can choose up to a **one month period at a time**.
> - When viewing statements in the dashboard, a maximum of 10,000 transactions are displayed.

By default, results are shown starting from the most recent transaction. You can change the order by pressing on the respective column in the header of the table.

## Export statements

After having selected the wallet and time period you are interested in, you can press the "Export statement" button to generate a CSV file with the results.

You will be asked to confirm this action and then taken to the [History]() page to download the resulting CSV file.

> **Please note!**  
> - You can choose up to a **one month period** at a time.
> - All transactions for the period will be exported (no 10,000 transaction limit).
> - The export might take some time to generate. The [History](/dashboard/finances/history) page will refresh itself automatically to show the latest status.
