title: Callback resend
---

When a payment is completed, we communicate the final status to your systems by sending a callback. 
However, delivery of these callbacks may be unsuccessful due to network instabilities, downtime in the receiving system, or similar issues. 
In such scenarios, you have the option to resend the callback through our dashboard.

The option to resend a callback is only available when our initial attempt to deliver it has been unsuccessful. In the event of a problematic transaction, you can navigate to the respective payment details page. Here, you'll find the option to resend the callback.

To resend the callback, click on the 'Resend callback' button.

The process should conclude within a few seconds, and a confirmation message will appear upon its successful completion.

<Tip>
    There is also an option to initiate this process via an API call. 
    Read more about this from our API documentation for [deposits](/v1/api-reference/deposits/resend-deposit-callback), [payouts](/v1/api-reference/payouts/resend-payout-callback) and [refunds](/v1/api-reference/refunds/resend-refund-callback).
