You can find the glossary of the data found on the deposit details from the [Payouts](/dashboard/transactions/payouts) documentation.

<Tip>
    On successful payouts, the MNO transaction ID is available. 
    This ID is also available to the customer on their SMS receipt or their transaction history. 
    When contacted by a customer, their transaction can be found using this ID.
