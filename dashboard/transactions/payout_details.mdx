You can see the details of a deposit by using either our [Global search](/dashboard/global_search) or [Payouts](/dashboard/transactions/payouts) search functionality and clicking on the specific payment.

You can find the glossary of the data found on the deposit details from the [Payouts](/dashboard/transactions/payouts) documentation.

All possible statuses of transactions are documented in [Transaction statuses](/dashboard/transactions/transaction_statuses).
