title: Cancel enqueued payout
---

During certain incidents with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), pawaPay may temporarily suspend the processing of payouts. However, we understand the importance of maintaining the flow of your transactions. Therefore, we continue to accept your payout requests during these periods.

These requests are assigned a status of **Enqueued**. This status indicates that your payout request has been received and is in line for processing as soon as the network stabilizes. However, you have the option to cancel these transactions if you choose by navigating to the respective payment details page and initiating a cancellation from there.

To cancel an Enqueued transaction, click on the "Cancel transaction" button.

The process should conclude within a few seconds, and a confirmation message will appear upon its successful completion.
