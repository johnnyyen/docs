You can see the details of a deposit by using either our [Global search](/v1/docs/global-search) or [Deposits](/v1/docs/deposits) search functionality and clicking on the specific payment.

You can find the glossary of the data found on the deposit details from the [Deposits](/v1/docs/deposits) documentation.

All possible statuses of transactions are documented in [Transaction statuses](/v1/docs/transaction-statuses).
