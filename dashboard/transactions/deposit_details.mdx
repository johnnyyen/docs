---

You can see the details of a deposit by using either our [Global search](/dashboard/global_search) or [Deposits](/dashboard/transactions/deposits) search functionality and clicking on the specific payment.

You can find the glossary of the data found on the deposit details from the [Deposits](/dashboard/transactions/deposits) documentation.

All possible statuses of transactions are documented in [Transaction statuses](/dashboard/transactions/transaction_statuses).

<Tip>
    On successful deposits, the MMO transaction ID is available. 
    This ID is also available to the customer on their SMS receipt or their transaction history. 
    When contacted by a customer, their transaction can be found using this ID.

<Info>
    We constantly monitor and improve the failure reasons to be as precise and accurate as possible.  
    Some Mobile Money Operators (MMO) do not provide specific failure reasons for failed transactions.
