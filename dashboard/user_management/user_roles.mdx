title: User roles
---

To ensure functionality and data is visible to only the people you need, we provide user roles and country-based limitations for users.

## Country based limitations

Users' access in our dashboard can be limited to specific countries.

For example, limiting a user's access to Ghana only as their tasks involve providing support for Ghana customers.

## User roles

Roles limit users to specific functionality in the dashboard. For example, User Management could only be enabled for the Team Leads of your different support teams. They are then able to invite new users independently. They are only able to invite users with all or some of the roles they have for their user.
