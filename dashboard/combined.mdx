title: Wallets
---

On the pawaPay platform, all of your mobile money is stored in wallets. In most cases, wallets are issued per country and hold all your available mobile money in that country.

On the Wallets page, you can see running balances of all your wallets and also have an option to choose a breakdown of those wallets to see what kind of transactions have occurred.

## Balance overview

In the balance overview section of the page, you can see each of your wallets and their:
- Country
- Current balance
- Currency
- Mobile Network Operator (MNO)

<Frame>
    ![Wallet Overview](/images/dashboard/finances/wallet_overview.png)
</Frame>

You can also click on one of the wallets to see the breakdown of that balance.

<Info>  
    In normal circumstances, wallets are issued per country. 
    If no MNO is displayed for a wallet, then all payments in that country are done through this wallet.
</Info>

## Wallet breakdown

Having clicked on one of your wallets, you need to choose a time range for which you would like to see the wallet breakdown.

<Frame>
    ![Wallet Breakdown](/images/dashboard/finances/wallet_breakdown.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
    You can use the quick filters below the date picker to quickly see yesterday's, last week's, or last month's wallet breakdown.
</Tip>

After pressing **Search**, you will see the different types of transactions that have affected your wallet balance during that period.

Together with the opening and closing balance for the selected period, you will also see the total value of:
- Deposits
- Payouts
- Fees
- Withdrawals
- Top ups
- Adjustments

You can always export your results into a CSV file.

<Frame>
    ![Export to CSV](/images/dashboard/finances/export_to_csv.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
    The wallet breakdown is shown from **midnight to midnight** in the UTC time zone.
    
    You can choose up to **one month** period at a time.
</Info>---
title: Global search

Any payment on our platform can be found quickly and easily using our global search which is always at the top left corner of the dashboard.

This functionality is available to users with the Transactions role. 
Read more about [User roles](/dashboard/user_management/user_roles).

## How to search
Enter one of the following into the search bar:

* Phone number (MSISDN)
* MNO Transaction ID
* Transaction ID (deposit ID, payout ID, refund ID)
* Full Metadata value
  * Metadata is searched based on full value of the metadata field. For example, searching for 12345, to find INV-12345, will not find results.

Our platform uses callbacks to notify you of the final statuses of payments. You can read more about how callbacks are used on our platform from [our API docs](/using_the_api#callback-urls).

This functionality is available to users with the Technical Administration role. Read more about [User roles](/dashboard/user_management/user_roles).

## Specifying the callback URLs

Please enter the URL at which you wish to receive notifications about the [final statuses](/dashboard/transactions/transaction_statuses) of payments. You can use the same URL for all types.

    If you are using a firewall, ensure that you have whitelisted our IPs. 
    The IPs can be found in our [API docs](/using_the_api#callback-urls).

If you do not plan to use our API (i.e., you are only planning to use our [Batch disbursements](/dashboard/other/batch_disbursements) or will be polling for status, please indicate that by checking the below checkbox.

The pawaPay dashboard supports two methods of user authentication: traditional password-based authentication and Google-based authentication.

Should you opt for Google-based authentication, your organization must already utilize [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/), or a comparable service where Google manages email addresses. This feature facilitates a seamless login process, allowing users to access our portal using their existing Google accounts.

<Tip>
    We recommend forcing 2-step verification on your Google Workspace account for increased security.

title: Topping up your wallets
---

In order to make payments via our disbursement API, your wallet must have sufficient funds available. Where a disbursement request is made and the wallet has insufficient balance to complete the transaction, the transaction will fail. 

Accordingly when you intend to use disbursements you may be required to pre-fund (top up) your pawaPay wallet.

In order to streamline the process you are encouraged to follow the instructions below whenever a top up is being made to your pawaPay wallet. 

## Send your funds to the correct bank account

When sending funds to top up your wallet in a particular country, you are requested to send those funds to the bank account for the respective market included in the list at the bottom of this page.

## Notify our team of your top up

<Steps>
    <Step title="Transfer the funds">
        Transfer the funds to one of our bank accounts depending on how and where you are topping up.

        Find all the bank accounts [below](/dashboard/topping_up#bank-accounts-for-pre-funding).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Let us know">
        After you have sent us funds, you can inform us of a top-up by pressing on the "Support" button in the lower left corner of the page in our dashboard.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/dashboard/support_widget_button.png" width="100" noZoom="true" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose the right option">
        Press on the "Wallet top up request" option to let our treasury team know.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/dashboard/support_widget_topup.png"/>
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fill the details">
        Populate the details requested on the support form so we know where the funds are arriving and where they should be allocated.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Attach PoP">
        Please attach a Proof of Payment (SWIFT confirmation) to the support form.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Press send">

    </Step>
</Steps>

Our team will be in touch with you as soon as possible to confirm receipt of the funds and that your top up has been actioned. 

Our team will also confirm the exchange rate used if the pre funding was made in a currency other than the local currency of the market in which your pawaPay wallet is held.

title: Callback resend
---

When a payment is completed, we communicate the final status to your systems by sending a callback. 
However, there might be instances when the delivery of these callbacks is unsuccessful due to network instabilities, downtime in the receiving system, or similar issues. 
In such scenarios, you have the option to resend the callback through our dashboard.

The option to resend a callback is only available when our initial attempt to deliver it has been unsuccessful. In the event of a problematic transaction, you can navigate to the respective payment details page. Here, you'll find the option to resend the callback.

<Frame>
    ![Payment Details](/images/dashboard/transactions/payment_details.png)
</Frame>

To resend the callback, click on the 'Resend callback' button.

<Frame>
    ![Resend Callback Button](/images/dashboard/transactions/resend_callback_button.png)
</Frame>

The process should conclude within a few seconds, and a confirmation message will appear upon its successful completion.

<Frame>
    ![Confirmation Message](/images/dashboard/transactions/confirmation_message.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
    There is also an option to initiate this process via an API call. 
    Read more about this from our API documentation for [deposits](/v1/api-reference/deposits/resend-deposit-callback), [payouts](/v1/api-reference/payouts/resend-payout-callback) and [refunds](/v1/api-reference/refunds/resend-refund-callback).
</Tip>---
title: Cancel enqueued payout
---

During certain incidents with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), pawaPay may temporarily suspend the processing of payouts. 
However, we understand the importance of maintaining the flow of your transactions. 
Therefore, we continue to accept your payout requests during these periods.

These requests are assigned a status of **Enqueued**. 
This status indicates that your payout request has been received and is in line for processing as soon as the network stabilizes. 
However, you have the option to cancel these transactions by navigating to the respective payment details page and initiating a cancellation from there.

<Frame>
    ![Cancel Transaction Page](/images/dashboard/transactions/cancel_transaction_page.png)
</Frame>

To cancel an Enqueued transaction, click on the "Cancel transaction" button.

<Frame>
    ![Cancel Button](/images/dashboard/transactions/cancel_button.png)
</Frame>

The process should conclude within a few seconds, and a confirmation message will appear upon its successful completion.

<Frame>
    ![Confirmation Message](/images/dashboard/transactions/confirmation_message_cancel.png)

<Tip>
    There is also an option to initiate this process via an API call.

</Warning>---
title: User roles
---

To ensure functionality and data is visible to only the people you need, we provide user roles and country-based limitations for users.

## Country based limitations

Users' access in our dashboard can be limited to specific countries.

For example, limiting a user's access to Ghana only as their tasks involve providing support for Ghana customers.

## User roles

Roles limit users to specific functionality in the dashboard. For example, the User Management role could be enabled only for the Team Leads of your different support teams. They are then able to invite new users independently. They are only able to invite users with all or some of the roles they have for their user.

| Role                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
