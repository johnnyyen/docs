title: Callback URLs
---

Our platform uses callbacks to notify you of the final statuses of payments. You can read more about how callbacks are used on our platform from [our API docs](/using_the_api#callback-urls).

This functionality is available to users with the Technical Administration role. Read more about [User roles](/dashboard/user_management/user_roles).

## Specifying the callback URLs

Please enter the URL at which you wish to receive notifications about the [final statuses](/dashboard/transactions/transaction_statuses) of payments. You can use the same URL for all types.

<Warning>
    Ensure you enter the correct URL.
    If you are using a firewall, ensure that you have whitelisted our IPs. 
    The IPs can be found in our [API docs](/using_the_api#callback-urls).
</Warning>

If you do not plan to use our API (e.g., you are only planning to use only our [Batch disbursements](/dashboard/other/batch_disbursements) or will be polling for final status, please indicate that by checking the below checkbox.
