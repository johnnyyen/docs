title: Callback URLs
---

Our platform uses callbacks to notify you of the final statuses of payments. You can read more about how callbacks are used on our platform from [our API docs](/using_the_api#callback-urls).

This functionality is available to users with the Technical Administration role. Read more about [User roles](/dashboard/user_management/user_roles).

## Specifying the callback URLs

![Specify Callback URLs](/images/dashboard/other/specify_callback_urls.png)

Please enter the URL where you wish to receive notifications about [final statuses](/dashboard/transactions/transaction_statuses) of payments. You can use the same URL for all types.

> **Please note!**  
> Make sure you enter the correct URL, and if you are using a firewall, ensure that you have whitelisted our IPs. The IPs can be found in our [API docs](/using_the_api#callback-urls).

If you do not plan to use our API (i.e., you are only planning to use our [Batch disbursements](/dashboard/other/batch_disbursements) or will be polling for status, please indicate that by checking the below checkbox.
