title: Callback URLs
---

Our platform uses callbacks to notify you of the final statuses of payments. You can read more about how callbacks are used on our platform from [our API docs](https://docs.pawapay.co.uk/#section/Using-the-API/Callback-URLs).

This functionality is available to users with the Technical Administration role. Read more about [User roles](/v1/docs/user-roles).

## Specifying the callback URLs

![Specify Callback URLs](https://cdn.document360.io/32e6fd9e-30a7-4a81-b2d6-2f89eb3bbb0d/Images/Documentation/cu1.png)

Please enter the URL where you wish to receive notifications about [final statuses](/v1/docs/transaction-statuses) of payments. You can use the same URL for all types.

> **Please note!**  
> Make sure you enter the correct URL, and if you are using a firewall, ensure that you have whitelisted our IPs. The IPs can be found in our [API docs](https://docs.pawapay.co.uk/#section/Using-the-API/Callback-URLs).

If you do not plan to use [our API](https://docs.pawapay.co.uk/) (i.e., you are only planning to use our [Batch disbursements](/v1/docs/batch-disbursements)), please indicate that by checking the below checkbox.
