This functionality is available to users with the Batch Disbursements role. Read more about [User roles](/dashboard/user_management/user_roles).

## Creating your batch disbursements file

You can download a template directly from the dashboard to create a new batch disbursement file.

## Uploading your batch disbursement file

After filling in your file, you can proceed to upload it into our system for validation. Your file will be validated for formatting errors and to ensure your account has configuration in place to disburse to the specified MNOs.

The results of validation will be shown directly in the dashboard.

| Result | Description                                                       |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ready  | The transaction is ready to be disbursed.                         |
| Failed | Transaction is not valid. You can hover on the transaction to see the failure reason. |

## Fixing validation failures

When encountering failures in your batch disbursement file, you can press the "Download Results" button to retrieve your batch disbursement file together with the failure reasons.

You can fix the errors in this file and attempt to upload again.

<Tip>
    You can re-upload the file downloaded by pressing the "Download Results" button to attempt again.  
    
    You do not need to remove the failure reasons from this file before re-uploading.

## Initiating the batch disbursements

If every transaction is "Ready", you can press the "Schedule payment" button to initiate the disbursements.
