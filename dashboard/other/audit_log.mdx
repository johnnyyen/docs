Every action taken in our dashboard is kept tracked and visible in the Audit Log. 
You can find here any changes to user permissions, new users invited, who signed into the portal and when, etc.

This functionality is available to users with the Administrator role. Read more about [User roles](/dashboard/user_management/user_roles).

<Warning>
    We strongly recommend using only personalised accounts on our platform - all accounts should be accessible to a single person. 
    This allows for compliant auditability of all actions taken on our dashboard.
