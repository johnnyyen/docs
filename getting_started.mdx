The pawaPay API enables you to pay and get paid with mobile money in Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Starting is easy:
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an account with pawaPay">
        If you haven't done so already, [create an account](https://dashboard.sandbox.pawapay.cloud/#/merchant-signup) in our sandbox. 
        It only takes a few minutes and you can start testing our API immediately.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Skip setting up callbacks...we will come back to this later">
        Once you've signed into the dashboard, go to [System Configuration>Callback URLs](https://dashboard.sandbox.pawapay.cloud/#/system/callback-url). 
        Let's skip setting up callbacks for now and just tick theb checkbox.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate the API token">
        Now go to [System configuration>API tokens](https://dashboard.sandbox.pawapay.cloud/#/system/api-token) and generate one for yourself.

        </Frame>
        <Info>
            Please store it immediately. We do not store the tokens in pawaPay for security reasons.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open our API in Postman">
        [<img src="https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg" alt="Run In Postman" width="128" height="32"/>](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/25129489-6a341d8f-4bd0-4699-9152-3cd6af8c3e50?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D25129489-6a341d8f-4bd0-4699-9152-3cd6af8c3e50%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D8c3e7775-3da5-4bab-8a8c-ffb331ccfe27)

        Fork our API to your workspace in Postman.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up an environment in Postman">
        Add the following variables into your environment:
        | Variable | Value |
        |----------|-------|
        | apiToken | Paste the token you just generated as the value |
        | baseUrl  | https://api.sandbox.pawapay.cloud |
    </Step>
    <Step title="All done.">
        You can now start sending requests to the pawaPay API in sandbox. Try "Request deposit" for example.

        Oh wait...did you want callbacks also?
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up a mock server in Postman">
        1. Select the "pawaPay Merchant API" as the collection to mock.
        2. Name the server how you please.
        3. Choose the environment you just created.
        4. Press "Create Mock Server"
        5. Copy the mock server URL.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set up callbacks">
        Go (again) to [System configuration>Callback URLs](https://dashboard.sandbox.pawapay.cloud/#/system/callback-url).
        
        Press "Edit" and paste the callback URL you copied from Postman to the input boxes.

        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/dashboard/other/specify_callback_urls.png" />
        </Frame>

        Once configured for all your flows, press "Save".
    </Step>
    <Step title="And done...again!">
        Go back to Postman and fire a couple of those "Request deposit" calls.

        You will receive a callback to the mock server. Check the request body section to see it.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Well...we do suggest going through the rest of our documentation also. It has lots of useful information about...">
