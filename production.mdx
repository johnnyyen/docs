title: Moving to production
---

## Overview

When you are ready to move from the sandbox environment to production, make sure you are using the correct [base URL](/using_the_api#where-is-the-api) and the correct [authentication token](/using_the_api#authentication). 
These are the only parameters that differ between sandbox and production.

<Tip>We recommend keeping those parameters in your environment-specific configuration.</Tip>

If you use IP whitelisting, ensure that [our IPs are whitelisted](/using_the_api#callback-urls) so we can deliver callbacks to you.

## Go-live testing

We recommend implementing a feature flag for your integration with pawaPay to enable go-live testing in production, before market launch. 
This allows you to test the end-to-end flow in production to uncover any environment-specific problems before they impact customers.

To test live payments, you will need the following for each MNO that you use:

* A phone and phone number with the specific MNO.
* An active mobile money wallet on that phone number.
* An available balance on the mobile money wallet to conduct the tests with.
* Be ready to enter the PIN code on the phone approximately 1-60 seconds from initiating the payment through our API.
