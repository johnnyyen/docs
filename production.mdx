title: Moving to production
---

## Overview

When you are ready to move from the sandbox environment to production, make sure you are using the correct [base URL](#section/Using-the-API/Where-is-the-API) and the correct [authentication token](#section/Using-the-API/Authentication). 
These are the only parameters that should be different between sandbox and production.

<Info>We recommend keeping those parameters in your environemnt specific configuration.</Info>

If you use IP whitelisting, make sure [our IP-s are whitelisted](/#section/Using-the-API/Callback-URLs) to ensure we can deliver you callbacks.

## Go-live testing

We recommend implementing a feature flag for your integration with pawaPay to enable go-live testing in production, before market launch. 
This allows you to test the end-to-end flow in production to uncover any environemnt specific problems without affecting customers.

To test live payments you will need for each MNO that you use:

* A phone and phone number with the specific MNO.
* An active mobile money wallet on that phone number.
* An available balance on the mobile money wallet to conduct the tests with.
* Be ready to enter the PIN code on the phone around 20-60 seconds from initiating the payment through our API.
